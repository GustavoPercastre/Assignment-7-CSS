# Assignment-7-CSS
This week I will be demonstrating your ability to create basic layouts using the CSS grid. I will take a set of starter files and, by only editing the CSS stylesheet, I will format the page so that it creates a layout with a header on top, a navbar on the left, a main in the middle, a sidebar on the left, and a footer on the bottom.
